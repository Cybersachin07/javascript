JavaScript

- JavaScript is a light weight interpreted and JIT compiled programming language.
- Interpreted allows to translate line-by-line of program.
- Compiled allows to translate all lines simultaneously at the same time.
- There are 2 types of compiling techniques
    a) JIT
    b) AOT
- JIT is Just-in-Time, it translates only when requested.
- AOT is Ahead-of-Time, it translated before request. It is pre-compiled.
- JavaScript is a language that supports various programming paradigms like
    a) Functional
    b) Structural
    c) Imperative
    d) Object Oriented etc.
 
- JavaScript is a language, which is used in various application areas like
    a) Client Side
    b) Server Side
    c) Database
    d) Animation Tools etc.

JavaScript Client Side:

- A client side script can reduce the burden on server.
- It runs on client machine to handles
    a) Browser Interactions
    b) DOM Interactions
    c) Validations
    d) State etc..
- Browser Interactions include details like
    - window
    - location
    - navigator
    - history
    - document
- DOM interactions include
    - Adding elements

Evolution of JavaScript:
- CERN labs [Council for European Research & Nuclear] developed as script called ECMA Script in early 1990's for a browser called "Mosaic".
- Netscape Communications started a new browser called "Netscape Navigator" in the early 1995.
- Netscape appointed "Brendan Eich" to design a client side script for Netscape Navigator browser.
- Brendan Eich design a script by name "Mocha", which was later renamed to "Live Script".
- Netscape given the responsibility of Live Script to "Sun Microsystems".
- Sun Microsystems renamed the script to "JavaScript".
- In the year 2000 Netscape stopped its services and given the responsibility of JavaScript to "ECMA".
- ECMA evolves and maintains JavaScript from 2000.
- The latest version of JavaScript is  "ES15".
